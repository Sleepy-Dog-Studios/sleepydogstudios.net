<br><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We only process your personal information when we 
believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to 
do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to

<span class="auto-style1"><strong><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this 
section applies to you.</em></strong></span><br>
<br>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to 
explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal 
information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your 
personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have 
	given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a 
	specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click
	<a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.<br></li>
	<li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information

	we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital 
	interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats 
	to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="auto-style1"><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this 
section applies to you.</em></strong></span><br><br>We may process your 
information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to 
use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where 
your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your 
consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.<br>
<br>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law

	cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
	<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is 
	necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
	<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with 
	next of kin</li>
	<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or 
	may be victim of financial abuse</li>
	<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would 
	compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the 
	collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of 
	an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
	<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court 
	order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
	<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, 
	business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes 
	for which the information was produced</li>
	<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary 
	purposes</li>
	<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the 
	regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style3">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</span></strong><br>
<br>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this 
section and/or with the following third parties.<br><br>We may need to share your personal 
information in the following situations:</p>

<p><strong><span class="auto-style3">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</span></strong><br><br><strong>In 
Short:</strong>
<em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes 
outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em><br><br>We will only keep 
your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set 
out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or 
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).<br><br>When we 
have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, 
we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible 
(for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup 
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it 
from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style3">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</span></strong><br><br><strong>In 
Short:</strong>
<em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of 
organizational and technical security measures.</em><br><br>We have implemented 
appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures 
designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. 
However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no 
electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can 
be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, 
cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat 
our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission 
of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should 
only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style3">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</span></strong><br><br><strong>In Short:</strong>

(UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control 
over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your 
account at any time.</em><br><br>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada),

<p><strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong><br><br>Most web 
browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a 
Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy 
preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and 
collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and 
implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently 
respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically 
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online 
tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about 
that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
