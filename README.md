This is the official repository for the Sleepy Dog Studios Website.


## Contribution
If you would like to contribute to the website, we ask that you follow the steps below!

1. Find an issue to fix or have an idea of something you would like to add/fix. (You can find currently known issues in the issues tab above the repository.
2. Once you know what you are going to be working on, clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch. Name your new branch something that is short but explains what you are doing on that branch. **DO NOT EDIT AN EXISTING BRANCH!**
4. Once you have made your changes, test them locally and make sure everything still functions as normal.
5. Create a new pull request referencing the branch that you create and made the changes on. The first part of the title of your pull request should be something like [fix], [feature], [addition], etc.. followed by the title. If your pull request directly addresses a currently known issue in the issues tab, reference it by number in your pull request description. For example, if my pull request references issue number 8, I would put #8 in my pull request description.
6. Once your pull request has been created, wait for a member of Sleepy Dog Studios to look at your pull request, if it is approved, it will be merged into the main branch and the branch you made changes on will be safely deleted. There is a possibility that one of the members will request that you make changes. Keep an eye on your pull request while it is in the review process in case that changes are requested.
7. Happy contributing!
